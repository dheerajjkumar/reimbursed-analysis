# Reimbursed Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of reimbursement data. The following steps were undertaken to refine and derive insights:

1. *Import Data and Power Query*
   - Imported the dataset and utilized Power Query for subsequent operations.

2. *Cleanse Data*
   - Corrected spelling and punctuation errors in the Expense Type column.
   - Standardized and made project names uniform.

3. *Address Missing Values in Currency*
   - Created a new custom column based on amount conditions:
      - If amount >= 1000, currency = INR.
      - If amount < 1000, currency = USD.
      - Else, currency = EURO.

4. *Currency Normalization*
   - Developed a formula to normalize the amount column into INR based on the currency column.

5. *Measure Creation*
   - Formulated a measure to calculate the sum of reimbursed amounts in INR.
   - Utilized the CALCULATE function to check the total reimbursed amount for Project_B (PROJECT B).

6. *Declined Requests*
   - Created a measure (declined) to count the number of declined requests.

7. *Visualization*
   - Implemented a slicer visual for easy selection of Project and employee.
   - Constructed a bar chart illustrating employees and their respective reimbursement amounts.
   - Designed a pie chart showcasing the distribution of reimbursement amounts across projects.
